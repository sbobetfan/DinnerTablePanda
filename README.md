# DinnerTablePanda

This program allows the Panda robot arm to sort three objects according to a user's request.

The easiest way to see this code run on your own machine is if you follow MoveIt's 'Getting Started' tutorial, found here http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/getting_started/getting_started.html 

Within all the Example Code downloaded in this tutorial, you want to look for the code responsible for the Python Move Group Interface tutorial, which is found here with the directory path also shown: https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_tutorials/tree/melodic-devel/doc/move_group_python_interface/scripts/move_group_python_interface_tutorial.py

Locate this file in your downloaded example code, and swap all the code inside with my code.
Now you can follow the steps in the Move Group Tutorial to execute the code.

This program represented the major coding component of my undergraduate final year project. __
The project was awarded a grade A, final mark 72.3.
